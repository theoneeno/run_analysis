 There are 30 volunteers in the data (labeled 1,2,3...28,29,30).Each volunteer has 6 activity.
In the tidy data set, each row means a volunteer and one activity, so there are 3*60 180 rows(observations).
There are 81 variables.The first column,labeled "subject", is the number of volunteer.The second colum,labeled "activity", is the activity and it is a factor class.
The rest 79 variables are data from the signal.
The are:

I extract all the mean and std data from the raw data, and calculate average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
So the tidy data set is 180 observations and 81 variables.
